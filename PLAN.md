# Ride measurement app (Android first, personal use)

## Context
Record rides (train, bus, etc.) with the highest-fidelity sensor data possible,
primarily for offline analysis, with some lightweight live analysis on the phone.
Offline results are authoritative: anything computed live can be recomputed better later (smoother, more context).
Audio and video are deferred to later improvements.
Many rides start in or just after tunnels, so the design must not depend on an initial GNSS fix,
and must not trust network (cell/WiFi) location, which can report the wrong underground station.

## Phase 0: Repo
- `git init` in `/home/khyber/work/ride-measurement-app`, add this plan as `PLAN.md`, commit.
- `gh repo create kkysen/ride-measurement-app --public --source . --push` (user explicitly asked for a public GitHub repo).
- Every later edit to the plan gets its own commit (one commit per separate change), pushed only when asked.

## Platform
- **Native Android app (Kotlin), not a PWA.** A PWA gets only fused, low-rate `Geolocation` (no raw GNSS, no Doppler),
  throttled `DeviceMotion`, no barometer/cell/WiFi data, and is killed when the screen locks.
- **Install by sideloading**, no Play Store review: enable developer mode, install over USB with Android Studio or `adb install`.
  (Google is rolling out developer identity verification for sideloaded apps on certified devices;
  `adb`/Android Studio installs to your own phone stay available, and friends would need either that or a free hobbyist registration.)
- **iPhone later**: keep the session format and fusion pipeline phone-agnostic so an iOS logger is a thin Swift app.
  iOS has no raw GNSS and no cell/WiFi scan APIs, so iPhone rides are less accurate; raw GNSS is optional in the pipeline.
  Install: free Apple ID signing (re-sign every 7 days) for yourself, or $99/yr developer account + TestFlight for friends.

## Rust core for performance-sensitive and shared code
- Platform shells stay thin (Kotlin on Android, Swift on iOS later): sensor callbacks, UI, foreground service.
- Shared Rust crate for heavy or reused algorithms: live EKF, rail-joint detection, map-matching.
  Built for Android with `cargo-ndk`, bindings to Kotlin and Swift via `uniffi`,
  and to Python via `pyo3`/`maturin`, so live and offline processing run the exact same code.
- The logger stays in Kotlin: it is mostly Android API calls and file appends,
  and crossing into Rust per sensor sample would cost more than it saves.
- The session format is defined by a `.proto` schema, not a Rust library, so every language reads it natively.
- Prototype fusion in Python; create the Rust crate in Phase 2 when the live EKF moves to the phone,
  then port proven algorithms into it.

## Phase 1: Logger app (main focus)
Foreground service + wake lock, runs screen-off for hours.
One clock for everything: `elapsedRealtimeNanos`; also log GNSS clock to map to UTC.

Streams:
- **GNSS raw** (`GnssMeasurement`): pseudorange, pseudorange-rate (Doppler, gives velocity directly, ~0.1 m/s),
  ADR (accumulated delta range = carrier phase, cm-level relative displacement when the chip tracks it),
  per-satellite C/N0; plus `GnssNavigationMessage`, `GnssStatus`, `GnssClock`.
  Enable Developer options > "Force full GNSS measurements" to disable **duty cycling**
  (the chip otherwise powers down between fixes to save battery, causing gaps and resetting carrier phase).
- **Location fixes**: GPS provider (with speed/bearing accuracy) and fused provider, logged but not trusted blindly.
- **IMU** at max rate (`HIGH_SAMPLING_RATE_SENSORS`, ~400 Hz): uncalibrated accel, gyro, mag only (they include the bias estimates);
  calibrated variants and rotation vector are derivable, so they are not stored.
- **Barometer**: altitude changes (1 hPa is about 8 m; phone sensors resolve a few cm to ~1 m of relative height over minutes),
  so underground platforms 10-30 m deep are 1-4 hPa below street level and each station's depth is a fingerprint.
  Tunnel entry/exit pressure waves scale with speed squared, so they are strong on HSR and weaker but often visible on subways,
  along with piston-effect swings as trains move through tunnels and into station boxes.
  Confounders: weather drift (slow, ~1 hPa/h at worst), car HVAC pressurization, doors opening. To validate on real subway rides.
- **Cell info** (`CellInfo`: cell IDs, signal strength) and **WiFi scans** (BSSIDs, RSSI):
  recorded as raw fingerprints, never as a position. We build our own station fingerprint map from labeled past rides.
  Cell info is passive: `requestCellInfoUpdate` returns what the modem already sees (serving + neighbor cells),
  so poll it every few seconds; it does not make the modem search and costs little.
  Also log `ServiceState` and `SignalStrength` changes (in/out of service, RAT, registered cell),
  which measures time-to-reconnect at each station, a useful dataset in itself.
  Normal apps cannot trigger a network search (`requestNetworkScan` needs carrier/system privileges) or toggle airplane mode.
- **Other cheap signals**: light sensor (tunnel detection), proximity (in pocket), battery/temperature.
  Step detection is derivable from accel, so it is not stored.
- **Manual event button**: tap "boarded", "at station X" (picked from nearby OSM stations), "alighted".
  Cheap and the most reliable underground ground truth.
- Optional toggle: audio, deferred by default, see rail joints note.
  Mono 16 kHz lossless FLAC is ~50-70 MB/h, roughly doubling the session size;
  Opus at ~24 kbps is ~10 MB/h but lossy, which conflicts with never losing data, so FLAC if recorded at all.
  Audio records conversations nearby, so it stays local and off by default.

Format: one directory per session, one file per stream, layout described in the Storage section.
GnssLogger-compatible text (for Google's tools and RTKLIB) is generated by an export tool, not stored.
Calibration: 10-30 s stationary at start when possible (IMU bias, gravity). Export via share sheet / `adb pull`.

## Storage
Rule: store only what cannot be recomputed later; everything derived is regenerated offline.
- Stored: uncalibrated IMU, raw GNSS + nav messages + clock, chip GPS fixes and fused fixes
  (both use inputs we lack, and are tiny), barometer, cell/WiFi scans, light, proximity, battery/temperature, manual events.
- Not stored: calibrated IMU, rotation vector, step detector, GnssLogger text, anything the live EKF computes.
- Encoding for high-rate streams: columnar chunks of a few seconds each.
  Every encoding must be bit-exact lossless: decoding returns the exact `float` bits Android delivered.
  Values: XOR with the previous value's bits (Gorilla-style) or byte-shuffle, then compress;
  timestamps: delta of delta, zigzag, then compressed.
  Integer quantization to `Sensor.getResolution` is only an optimization, never trusted:
  phones often misreport resolution and calibration rescales values off clean steps,
  so a chunk is quantized only if every value round-trips bit-exactly, otherwise it is stored as raw bits.
  Low-rate streams: length-delimited protobuf messages, compressed per chunk.
- Compression on the fly with `zstd` at a low level, one independent frame per chunk.
  At ~30 KB/s raw this costs negligible CPU, avoids a post-ride pass and the peak disk usage of uncompressed files,
  and a crash loses at most the current chunk. The downside is a slightly worse ratio than one big high-level pass.
- Post-ride recompress on the phone (while charging, or right after the ride): rewrite each stream as one file at a high `zstd` level.
  Never delete data before its replacement is verified: write the new file, `fsync`, decode it fully,
  compare every record against the original chunks (or a content hash of the decoded records), and only then delete the chunks.
  Any failure keeps the chunks and flags the session; sessions are also deleted from the phone only after the copy off it is verified the same way.
  Benchmark `zstd` vs `lz4` vs domain codecs on real rides before freezing the format; the `.proto` schema versions it.
- Rough size: ~80-100 MB/h before encoding, est. ~20-40 MB/h after; about 1 GB/month at 1 h/day.
  Sessions are copied off the phone (`adb pull` or sync) and deleted after verification.

## Battery
- Main costs: GNSS with duty cycling disabled, and the CPU waking for every 400 Hz sample.
- Use sensor batching (`maxReportLatencyUs` of a few seconds) so the hardware FIFO buffers samples and the CPU sleeps between batches;
  this is likely the biggest single saving. Write to disk in chunks, never per sample.
  Batching is lossless: same samples, same hardware timestamps, just delivered later.
  The one risk is FIFO overflow (dropped samples), so keep latency well under `Sensor.getFifoMaxEventCount` / rate
  (the FIFO is often shared between sensors), and detect gaps from timestamps; on any gap, shorten the latency automatically.
- WiFi scans are throttled by Android (4 per 2 min in the foreground); scan only while GNSS is lost,
  prioritizing when stopped, since a stop underground is almost always a station.
- Station detection, live: a stop (low IMU variance for several seconds) near an OSM station on the matched line;
  underground, a stop plus dwell length plus the along-track distance since the last known station picks the candidate.
  Offline, the HMM in Phase 3 makes the final call.
- Pass-through stations (express trains): predicted from the dead-reckoned along-track position against OSM stations,
  so the WiFi scan is scheduled to fire just before the predicted pass, widening the window as position uncertainty grows.
  Confirmed by signatures of passing through a station box: pressure step from the larger cross-section,
  light sensor brightening, a short burst of new WiFi BSSIDs, and switches/crossovers in the gyro just outside many stations.
  Each pass becomes a position fix offline, the same as a stop but weaker.
- Screen off during recording; live display is opt-in.
- Expect single-digit percent per hour; measure with `dumpsys batterystats` on real rides and record battery in the session.

## Phase 2: Live analysis (light)
Forward-only error-state EKF on the phone: IMU prediction, Doppler velocity and GPS position updates, ZUPTs.
Shows speed, along-track distance, current/next station. Results logged, but overwritten by offline processing.

## Phase 3: Offline fusion (Python: `numpy`, `scipy`, possibly `gtsam`)
1. **GNSS**: own WLS from raw measurements, or RTKLIB with a nearby CORS base station (free RINEX) for sub-meter;
   Doppler velocity; time-differenced ADR where available.
2. **Smoother**: error-state EKF + RTS backward pass, or factor graph. The backward pass is what solves tunnel starts:
   the first good fix after exiting propagates back through the tunnel segment.
3. **Vehicle constraints**: estimate phone-to-vehicle rotation, then non-holonomic constraint (no sideways/vertical velocity);
   **ZUPTs** (zero-velocity updates: when stopped, assert velocity = 0, which resets IMU drift) at stops detected from IMU variance.
4. **Map-matching to OSM track graph** (`railway=*`): reduces the train problem to 1-D along-track position;
   bus uses road graph. Station identity resolved by an HMM over the graph using inter-station distance (from integrated speed),
   dwell timing, barometer, own WiFi/cell fingerprints, and manual taps;
   network location enters only as a weak, outlier-gated hint, so a misconfigured station cell cannot override the rest.
5. **Rail joints**: periodic vertical jolts at rate = speed / rail length (often 12.5-25 m) give a GNSS-free speed estimate.
   Accel first: it measures the car body's jolt directly at 400 Hz, free since we record it anyway;
   it is damped when the phone is in a pocket or hand. Audio catches the higher-frequency clack and is less sensitive to how the phone is held,
   but also hears everything else. Expect accel to be enough on jointed track; add audio if the jolts get lost in damping.
   Caveat: continuously welded rail has no joints, but switches/expansion joints still give occasional landmarks.
6. **Curves and switches**: all derived from stored IMU + fused speed, nothing extra to record.
   With phone-to-car rotation known (from straight track), speed `v`, yaw rate `w` (gyro), and car-frame accel `a_lat`, `a_vert`:
   centripetal accel `v*w`, radius `v/w` (cross-checked against OSM geometry),
   car roll `phi = atan2(v*w, g) - atan2(a_lat, a_vert)`, cant `= track gauge (~1500 mm between rail centers) * sin(phi)`,
   and unbalanced lateral accel / cant deficiency = the lateral accel felt in the car.
   Caveat: the car body leans outward on its suspension in proportion to unbalanced accel, which biases cant.
   Separate them with repeat rides through the same curve at different speeds (cant is fixed, deficiency scales with `v^2`),
   or directly when stopped on a curve (`phi` is then pure cant plus a tiny lean).
   Switches: short yaw-rate S-curves and lateral jerk; record diverging vs straight route and speed.
   Build a per-curve database (radius, cant, max/typical speed, deficiency) from repeated rides.
7. **Door events**: only checked while stopped.
   Barometer: a small pressure step or transient when the car's HVAC-pressurized air meets the platform.
   Audio (if recorded): door chime, door motors, and the HVAC sound changing as outside air and noise come in.
   Also a small car sway in the IMU as passengers board. Gives dwell start/end and confirms a real station stop vs a signal hold.
8. **Mode classification** (later): IMU vibration spectra, then audio.
9. **Video** (later): visual odometry as a velocity factor; TrackSight-style localization only for routes repeated often.

## Verification
- Logger: per-stream rate/gap report; 1 h screen-off ride without dropouts.
- GNSS: Doppler speed vs position-derived speed agree on open sky; stationary noise floor.
- Fusion: synthetic GNSS outages on good data, error vs held-out truth;
  station-to-station distances vs OSM; correct station identity on rides starting underground.
